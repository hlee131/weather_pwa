# Weather Progressive Web App
This is a basic weather app that was used to learn more about Progressive Web Apps. It utilizes data from 3 APIs: 

1. Webcam images (windy.com)
2. Weather data (open-meteo.com)
3. Geocoding (opencagedata.com)

The frontend of the application was built with concepts from neumorphism in mind and implemented with React and TailwindCSS. Additionally, 
react-spring was used to integrate animations and transitions into various elements in the application to improve user experience.
